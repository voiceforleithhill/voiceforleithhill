&lt;p&gt;A petition aimed at demonstrating serious fears about the risk to local water supplies from oil drilling on Leith Hill is close to hundred thousand signatures. The petition, hosted by 38 Degrees, which is addressed to the Environment Agency (EA) titled ‘Don't risk water pollution from oil drilling on Leith Hill’ has been signed by over ninety-one thousand people, with more being added by the minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organisers of the petition will be officially handing it in on Thursday 1 March at 6:30pm during a public consultation at the Dorking Halls, where residents have been invited to talk to EA representatives about how they will regulate the proposed oil and gas activities on Leith Hill in Surrey. The site is within an officially designated area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local resident who started the petition said, “We are encouraged that so many people agree the water pollution risks from oil drilling using acid and other chemicals are unacceptable. We call on the Environment Agency to act on our concerns by rejecting this application. Short term oil extraction is increasingly being prioritised by our Government over the protection of our water resource. Water will ultimately be much more valuable and important to our Nation than oil. It's short term thinking at it's worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Water is both a vital natural resource and a heritage, which must be protected, defended and treated as such. We would like to invite any local people who have concerns over the safety of our water due to the proposed acidisation drilling process, to join us in handing in this petition. We hope it makes a difference to the EA’s decision”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns were initially sparked when Sutton and East Surrey Water (SESW) spoke out during the planning appeal process against Europa’s plans, stating that an accidental spill or leak could contaminate the aquifer used for public water supply. Lester Sonden, then director of SESW, said he was concerned about the potential for long-term contamination of water sources. He said “Our objection to drilling in this location is that it will increase the risk of polluting the aquifer that is used for public water supply. Besides the risk of contaminating our borehole sources at Dorking, there is also a risk that contamination could lead to pollution of the River Mole, which in turn could affect our sources at Leatherhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The EA has required additional protection against the risk in the short term, but longer term the risks are not so well understood. However well-designed, there is a risk of failure at some time in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public confidence is also dropping in two of the companies responsible for the drilling to foot the bill should a clean up of this scale be necessary. With over £50m wiped off UKOG’s share price recently due to possible formation damage from acid at Broadford Bridge oil well in Sussex and Europa’s share price going steadily down by over 66% in 5yrs, from over 12p in April 2013 to 3.85p on Wed 21st Feb, campaigners against the drilling fear this could end up costing the tax payer a lot more than they bargained for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency have opened a public consultation on the draft environmental permit they are now minded to issue following the original public consultation held in May 2017 regarding Europa's permit application. The consultation is open until 15th March 2018. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/psc/rh6-6hn-europa-oil-and-gas-limited/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;access it here&lt;/a&gt;. Please make sure to submit your comments in good time - thank you!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency are also inviting the local community to a drop-in event at Martineau Hall, Dorking Halls on 1 March 2018 between 2.00pm and 7.30pm where EA staff will be in attendance along with other regulatory bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive to answer questions and provide further information on the proposals from Europa Oil and Gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more information about this event on Facebook at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1972069006376555/permalink/1972070383043084/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1972069006376555/permalink/1972070383043084/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should oil exist under the Weald basin at all, oil speculators have stated that it will be in the form of &quot;tight oil&quot; deposits - which are locked into the rock formations rather than being conventional free-flowing reservoirs. Confusingly however, they also state they do not intend to conduct fracking to access it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weald Action Group have produced an excellent, informative leaflet which addresses this apparent contradiction, explaining how tight oil deposits can also be exploited using highly corrosive acids to dissolve the rock instead of hydraulic fracturing (&quot;fracking&quot;). You can &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/acidisation-infosheet.pdf&quot;&gt;download it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Voice for Leith Hill</name></author><summary type="html">Acidisation and Tight Oil</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Traffic Management Plan 2017/0212 - Email Template</title><link href="http://www.voiceforleithhill.co.uk/2018/01/20/traffic-management-plan/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Traffic Management Plan 2017/0212 - Email Template" /><published>2018-01-20T23:21:04+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-20T23:21:04+00:00</updated><id>http://www.voiceforleithhill.co.uk/2018/01/20/traffic-management-plan</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.voiceforleithhill.co.uk/2018/01/20/traffic-management-plan/">&lt;h2&gt;New Traffic Management Plan - Email Template&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi all, our &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/tmp-0212.pdf&quot;&gt;email template for the new Traffic Management Plan is now available here&lt;/a&gt;. The application can be viewed at Surrey Country Council's &lt;a href=&quot;https://planning.surreycc.gov.uk/planappdisp.aspx?AppNo=SCC%20Ref%202017/0212&quot;&gt;planning portal&lt;/a&gt; and is now open for public consultation until Feb 7th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N.B.&lt;/b&gt; this is a brand new application (because Europa are taking the previous one to appeal) which means that we please need EVERYONE to resubmit all their comments!! Surrey County Council have advised that we are effectively starting again with a clean slate, so all our previous objections need to go in again (providing they are still relevant) and we'll also get the chance to speak again when this proposal goes before the planning committee. Remember to include the new application number 2017/0212 plus your name and &lt;b&gt;full postal address&lt;/b&gt; in your response. Thank you!!

&lt;h2&gt;How Do I Submit Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the above template, you can email comments with your name and full postal address to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto: mwcd@surreycc.gov.uk&quot;&gt; mwcd@surreycc.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; quoting: SCC Ref 2017/0212 or you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://planning.surreycc.gov.uk/planappdisp.aspx?AppNo=SCC%20Ref%202017/0212&quot;&gt;comment online here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When Does The Consultation Close?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation closes on Feb 7th. If for some reason you absolutely can't submit comments by that date then there is still some value in submitting late. Although the council are not obliged to take account of comments received outside the formal consultation period, they may to choose to do so until shortly before the application goes to committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leith Hill is under threat from oil drilling which could start this autumn, bringing hundreds of HGV movements up the historic sunken lane between Dorking and Coldharbour. The 35 metre high oil rig which is planned for Coldharbour Lane dwarfs Leith Hill tower (the highest point in the Surrey Hills) and would add 24 hour lighting and security fencing to this unspoiled area for at least 18 weeks. The oil company – Europa – has applied to extend some of these impacts for a whole year&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leith Hill community picnic starts at 1pm, when people should arrive at the Leith Hill car parks or on foot, bike or horse, for the short climb up to the tower. Bring suitable footwear and clothing fit for whatever the weather has to offer plus a picnic. Short talks at 1.30, followed by community singing, childrens' art acitivities and finally the chance for everyone to get together and form a giant heart at the top of the hill.
Last year about 400 people gathered to form a heart shape. The organisers – A Voice for Leith Hill&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – are aiming for a similar (or hopefully bigger!) turnout this Saturday. All are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europa's traffic management planning application has now been published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://planning.surreycc.gov.uk/planappdisp.aspx?AppNo=SCC%20Ref%202017/0027&quot;&gt;Surrey Country Council's planning portal&lt;/a&gt; and is open for public consultation. Key points include:
  &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Between 700 and 1100+ HGV movements from A24, up Flint Hill, into Knoll Road and up Coldharbour Lane: exact volumes depend on whether HGV carriageways can be built with aluminium or if they require a stone base.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Major resulting impacts to &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;traffic&lt;/span&gt; flows across Dorking, which currently struggle to handle existing volumes and are highly prone to gridlock from even minor disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HGV convoy holding bay in Knoll Road, which as a residential road and main school route is completely unsuitable.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A further stone delivery HGV holding bay will be in Ryka's car park at Box Hill, as a feeder via A24 and Flint Hill into the Knoll Road holding bay.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Major and irreparable impact to the trees, banks and road surface of Coldharbour Lane, which is a historic sunken lane currently signposted as unsuitable for HGVs. It is absolutely unsuitable for 60 tonne crane carriers, 50 tonne drilling rig transporters and flatbeds carrying earth-moving machinery.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The proposal to identify drilling rig transporter passing places in Coldharbour Lane to reduce local transport delays is nonsensical: there aren't any places where a car could pass a 50 tonne drilling rig in transit on Coldharbour Lane.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The disruptions are likely to cause increased use of other backroads such as Logmore Lane, resulting in secondary damage there also.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Increased risk to road users: Europa's own &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;traffic&lt;/span&gt; survey admits there is a high risk to cyclists of a serious accident on Coldharbour Lane on Saturday mornings.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Road closures, delays and blockages are likely to endanger any residents who need emergency services.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The road condition survey &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/span&gt; includes no details about temporary damage assessments such as that from soil deposits which pose a major risk to cyclists and motorbikes, or ice, diesel spills or wet leaves which might impact the traction of HGVs on the steepest sections of Coldharbour Lane during winter months.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No Environmental Impact Assessment has been conducted for the &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Traffic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Management&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Plan&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/span&gt; is effectively just an addendum to the &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;traffic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;management&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/span&gt; from 2014 which has already been rejected as completely unsuitable by the &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;planning&lt;/span&gt; authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EA’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?topic=drinkingwater&amp;amp;layerGroups=default&amp;amp;lang=_e&amp;amp;ep=map&amp;amp;scale=4&amp;amp;x=357682.99999999994&amp;amp;y=355133.99999999994#x=516989&amp;amp;y=144076&amp;amp;lg=2,3,10,&amp;amp;scale=7&quot;&gt;water safeguard zone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/WaterBody/GB106039017580&quot;&gt;water catchment area maps&lt;/a&gt; show that the proposed drilling site is located directly next to a Surface Water Safeguard Zone and in the catchment area of the Pipp Brook directly upstream of a Groundwater Safeguard Zone. The potential impact of this location to the local drinking water supply has already been previously highlighted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-34930442&quot;&gt;Sutton and East Surrey Water.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the supplied Environmental Risk Assessment, the applicant identifies a number of Possible Sources of Accident with consequences of polluting the groundwater or surface water. They then claim that the overall risk is low providing the correct management techniques are followed. On this basis plus the related information supplied in their Waste Management Plan, they propose that they should be exempt from needing a groundwater permit. However:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if the probability of an accident is low providing the correct management techniques are followed, given the proximity of the water safeguard zones then the impact of any such incident will be very large. There is no way the overall risk can be classified as low as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No consideration is given to accidents relating to a failure to follow correct management techniques. What secondary measures are being implemented to reduce impact in the instance something does go wrong?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given this is exploratory drilling, what safeguards are being employed to mitigate any possibility of ‘accidental’ horizontal drilling from the drill pad on the edge of the water safeguard zones into the actual safeguard zone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no indication of linked and/or compound risks in the Risk Assessment. Clearly the risks are not all completely independent. How is the risk of a contamination incident increased by fire for example, which might lead to a seal failure and pipe rupture?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The high/medium/low risk classification is a subjective oversimplification that is clearly being misapplied in this application: the argument put forwards in the generic risk assessment table that the groundwater risk should only be classified as medium because it is not as severe as the surface water risk is nonsensical. Both risks are obviously high, it is just that one is larger than the other. A more quantitative approach would have avoided such problems and enabled a much more accurate risk profile to be described.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only short-term risks resulting from failures of storage tanks or pipe ruptures are considered. What about the risks from well casing failures? There there have been many instances of boreholes failing and becoming conduits of water contamination (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/03/us/abandoned-oil-and-gas-wells-become-pollution-portals.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shale.palwv.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SPE-166142-PA-P2-copy.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/SPE/a77592d6-ec9a-43b1-b57b-c7275fb91cb0/UploadedImages/SPE%20Review/Review%202013/SPE%20Review%20March%202013%20-%20Web%20Version.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In the longer term these represent a greater risk than storage tanks rupture, but they are not mentioned at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the water risks identified in the risk assessment are examples of low probability, high impact risks which are notoriously difficult to manage effectively. Generally, a strategy of prevention/avoidance is the only truly safe policy. Given the fact that this well is likely to have a very limited lifespan anyway due to the ever increasing threat from climate change (on which point, the glaring omission in the applicant’s Global Warming Potential section is the product they are actually drilling), and abandoning the well will then only increase the risk of future contamination incidents, the only reasonable and rationally defensible strategy is most obviously not to drill for oil in this location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Waste Management Plan, the applicant is requesting exemption from having to apply for groundwater permit on the basis that the quantity of the acidisation pollutant would be small. However, the applicant only specifies the volume of acid per foot. What is the total volume they will be using? Also what about the other chemicals such as the anti corrosives, surfactants and demulsifiers used in the acidisation process? These are also clearly contamination sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the limit of the applicant's liability insurance? Has the applicant sourced independent estimates of the clean-up costs of each risk identified in their Risk Assessment? Do any of these exceed their liability limit? In the instance that the applicant decided to cease trading following a contamindation incident, what insurances would remain in place and for how long?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2. Concerning Waste Management&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application uses the term ‘acid squeeze’. Assume this is in fact matrix acidisation, then the application should be amended to use standard industry terminology in the interests of clarity and transparency. Given the increasing regulation such techniques are being subjected to in other territories where they have not already been banned outright, this technique should not be allowed in the UK until a full impact assessment has been performed and regulatory guidance has been published.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens to the spent hydrochloric acid solution once it has been used to clean out the geological fractures? How is this monitored, and how visible are the test results to the public?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot oil will be pumped into the well to 'remove paraffin precipitates': What happens to the 'paraffin precipitates'? How is this monitored, and how visible are the test results to the public?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil-containing drilling muds, Oil-containing rock cuttings: What happens to them? How is this monitored, and how visible are the test results to the public?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Hazardous run-off water: How is this monitored, and how visible are the test results to the public?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radioactive materials: 'radioactive materials' are not all unnatural. Many shales are naturally radioactive due to the potassium isotopes in clays, as well as adsorbed uranium, radium, polonium and thorium. How will the applicant handle the processing of any naturally occurring and equally hazardous radioactive materials discovered during the exploratory drilling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt; 3. Concerning Local Authority Planning Permits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On page 4 of the Site Condition Report, the site footprint is stated as being 0.79 hectares. This is incorrect. The site is now in fact 1.01 hectares, as the applicant has extended the site footprint by 28% as part of a subsequent security fencing application that has been submitted to Surrey County Council. Ref: 2016/0170 http://planning.surreycc.gov.uk/planappdisp.aspx?AppNo=SCC%20Ref%202016/0170&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On page 19 of Site Condition Report, the applicant claims that no baseline monitoring can be performed until the start of operations. This is incorrect: on 21st October last year they were granted planning permission to commence baseline testing: https://planning.surreycc.gov.uk/planappdisp.aspx?AppNo=SCC%20Ref%202016/0151&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, the applicant has a farm-out deal for this site with Angus Energy who are currently contesting with Surrey County Council a possible breach of planning regulations at their Brockham site. No environmental permit should be granted until the outcome of that case in known, as a confirmed breach will significantly undermine the applicant’s claims to follow industry best practice on which much of its risk mitigation plan depends.&lt;/li&gt;
